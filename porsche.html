            n.Ferdinand Porsche (1875-1951) founded the company called "Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche GmbH" with Adol
            f Rosenberger and Anton Piëch in 1931. The main offices was at Kronenstraße 24 in the centre of S
            tuttgart, Initially, the company offered motor vehicle development work and consulting, but did 
            not build any cars under its own name. One of the first assignments the new company received was fro

            Volkswagen Beetle, one of the most successful car designs of all time.
            Ferdinand Porsche (1875–1951) founded the company called "Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche GmbH"[4] with Adolf Rosenberger[5] 
            and Anton Piëch in 1931.[6] The main offices was at Kronenstraße 24 in the centre of Stuttgart.[7] Initially, the company 
            offered motor vehicle development work and consulting,[4] but did not build any cars under its own name. One of the first 
            assignments the new company received was from the German government to design a car for the people; that is, a Volkswagen.[4]
             This resulted in the Volkswagen Beetle, 
            one of the most successful car designs of all time.[8] The Porsche 64 was developed in 1939 using many components from the 
            Beetle.During World War II,[9] Volkswagen production turned to the military version
            of the Volkswagen Beetle, the Kübelwagen,[9] 52,000 produced, and Schwimmwagen,[9] 15,584 produced.
            Porsche produced several designs for heavy tanks during the war, losing out to Henschel & Son in both contracts that
             ultimately led to the Tiger I and the Tiger II. However, not all 
            this work was wasted, as the chassis Porsche designed for the Tiger I was used as the base for the Elefant tank destroyer.
